    "General": "[Paragraph 1: VPN Friendliness & Anonymity]: If the casino is VPN friendly state that it is VPN friendly. Follow up by explaining why being VPN friendly is important (privacy, safety when online, this is especially important for players using crypto). If the casino isn’t VPN friendly, state that it is not VPN friendly and recommend one or two other brands that are VPN friendly from the Top Casinos which are VPN friendly. If the casino is anonymous (email only), say that it is an anonymous crypto casino (use one of different synonyms to describe this, for example: Anonymous crypto casino, Anonymous cryptocurrency casino, Anonymous bitcoin casino, Crypto casino with anonymity, Bitcoin casino offering anonymity), and explain why this is important to keep your anonymity, especially when using crypto. If the casino isn’t anonymous, say that it requires more than just an email to play, invite the reader to choose another brand, if such anonymity is important to them, and recommend one or two other brands that are anonymous from Top Casinos which are anonymous. [Paragraph 2: Casino age & Extra Products]:Only If the casino is older than 5 years, mention this as a good thing because this means they have experience and have been able to stand the test of time, which means they have been doing something right. The gambling industry is very fast-moving and often risky, so an ‘older’ casino is a good sign. It also means they have had more time to tighten up security, fix vulnerabilities, and build safer systems. Such casinos usually also have a more refined UI, less bugs, smoother gameplay, more games, exclusive partnerships, a more reliable payout speed and consistency, If the casino is not older than 5 years - DO NOT MENTION ANYTHING ABOUT ITS AGE. Only if the casino offers lottery or trading besides casino games and sports betting, mention this as something unique because most casinos don’t offer this. Offering lottery or trading makes a casino much more versatile, adding to user experience, and showing effort on behalf of the casino, If the casino does not offer lottery or trading - DO NOT MENTION ANYTHING ABOUT LOTTERY OR TRADING. Only If the casino’s look isn’t modern, comment on this fact because not keeping a brand up to date with modern style can mean a lack of care or a general challenge with keeping the brand competitive, If the casino has modern look - DO NOT MENTION ANYTHING ABOUT ITS LOOK BEING MODERN OR NOT.If none of the above are true, skip the second paragraph.[Paragraph 3: Restrictions & Chat Availability]:Check how many countries the casino restricts. If the casinos restricts over 40 countries, warn the reader to double-check if they’re eligible to play to avoid trouble, and recommend one or two other brands from the Top Casinos that restrict less than 40 countries. Only If the casino’s live chat is not available 24/7, warn the reader about it. Offering a responsive 24/7 live chat is considered the minimum standard for every decent casino, otherwise it can take days or longer for players to resolve any payment or account issues, if the casino has live chat available 24/7 - DO NOT MENTION ANYTHING ABOUT ITS LIVE CHAT AVAILABILITY.[Paragraph 4: Website Usability]:Only If the casino has any annoying pop-ups, warn the reader about it, otherwise DO NOT MENTION IT. While some players don’t mind pop-ups, especially if that means getting more promotions, most people find them disrupting. Only If the casino has any broken images or links, tell the reader that you found some, which is a sign that the casino hasn’t quite managed to get their site under control yet. This can mean a lack of care or a general challenge with keeping the brand working at 100%, if the casino has no broken images or links - DO NOT MENTION ANYTHING ABOUT BROKEN IMAGES OR LINKS.",
    "Payments": "[Paragraph 1: Withdrawal limits, cryptocurrencies and buying crypto]:State how friendly the withdrawal limits are by comparing the casino’s maximum withdrawal rating to a 0-9 scale, 0 being very unfriendly and 9 being very friendly. But don’t mention the rating or the scale specifically.If the casino accepts between 10 and 50 cryptocurrencies, state that it accepts less than 50 cryptocurrencies and offer a couple of brands which accept more cryptocurrencies. If the casino accepts between 50 and 100 cryptocurrencies, state that it accepts more than 50 cryptocurrencies and offer 2 more brands that accept similar or more cryptocurrencies from Top and Similar Casinos. If the casino accepts over 100 cryptocurrencies, state that the casino accepts more than 100 cryptocurrencies. Mention another brand as comparison that also offers more than 100 cryptocurrencies (do not use the exact value of its cryptocurrencies, just say it also accepts more than 100), taken from the Similar Casinos. If the casino has less than 10 accepted cryptocurrencies, state the number of cryptocurrencies and give the reader a kind heads up. Recommend one or two other brands that accept more cryptocurrencies, taken from the Top Casinos.If you can buy crypto in the casino, mention that the casino supports this, which despite not being ideal for buying crypto this way due to additional fees, it can still be less hassle if you run out of crypto and don’t have to move back and forth between the casino and an exchange. If the casino offers crypto conversion, mention it as something very unique and useful. Very few casinos offer this and it can mean that players can play with virtually any token that’s supported by the conversion tool. They can also deposit in one cryptocurrency and withdraw in another.If none of the above are true, skip the first paragraph. [Paragraph 2: By day, week, month withdrawal limits]:Explain how friendly are the casino's withdrawal limits by listing all limits available (by day, by week, by month) and commenting which are very good, very bad, or could be better based on the following criteria:Daily limits: anything over $3,000 is considered good and anything below $2,000 is considered not so good.Weekly limits: anything over $12,000 is considered good and anything below $8,000 is considered not so good.Monthly limits: anything over $24,000 is considered good and anything below $16,000 is considered not so good.[Paragraph 3: Withdrawal time & KYC verification speed]:State the withdrawal time (no need to comment on how good or bad it is and no need to compare to other casinos, we want a neutral comment and a heads up to user): For casinos with withdrawal time less than 12 hours, when mentioning how long it takes, use randomly one of the following responses - a matter of hours; Within a couple of hours; In a few hours. For casinos with withdrawal time 12-24 hours, when mentioning how long it takes, use randomly one of the following responses - Within a day; less than a day; less than 24 hours. For casinos with withdrawal time 24-72 hours, when mentioning how long it takes, use randomly one of the following responses -  a couple of days; less than three days; Within a few days. For casinos with withdrawal time more than 72 hours, when mentioning how long it takes, use randomly one of the following responses - More than three days; Three days and more; More than a couple of days. Explain that fast withdrawal time is important. State the KYC verification speed (no need to comment how good or bad it is and no need to compare KYC verification speed to other casinos): for casinos with KYC verification speed less than 12 hours, when mentioning how long it takes, use randomly one of the following responses - Within a couple of hours; a matter of hours; In a few hours. For casinos with KYC verification speed 12-24 hours, when mentioning how long it takes, use randomly one of the following responses - less than a day; less than 24 hours; Within a day. For casinos with KYC verification speed 24-72 hours, when mentioning how long it takes, use randomly one of the following responses - a couple of days; Within a few days; less than three days.

    "Games": "[Paragraph 1: Number of games and providers]:State the number of games and game providers in the casino, then comment on the numbers based on the following criteria (but do not mention the criteria): anything over 8000 games is a lot, anything below 5,000 games is low and can be improved, everything in between is average. More than 70 game providers is a lot, anything below 40 providers is not a lot, everything in between is average. [Paragraph 2: Provably fair games, in-house games]:State whether the casino has provably fair games or not. If it does, comment on the fact that this gives the players a chance to use the provably fair feature to test the game fairness themselves, and not just rely on 3rd party institutions that test RNGs for all other games. If the casino doesn’t have provably fair games, recommend a casino that has provably fair games, taken from the Top Casinos which have provably-fair games. Only If the casino has in-house games, state this and commend the casino on going the extra mile to offer their players something new and unique. In-house games are usually modern, fast-paces games, where casinos can even offer exclusive in-house promotions in, making for a much more diverse and unique user experience. If the casino does not have in-house games - DO NOT MENTION ANYTHING ABOUT IN-HOUSE GAMES.[Paragraph 3: game filters, additional filters]: If game filters in the casino are working properly, say that the gameplay and the general user experience when playing games is very nice and that the reader can expect a seamless experience. If game filters are not working properly, warn the reader that finding and filtering games can be glitchy and the casino needs to work on this some more to provide a better user experience. Instead, offer another brand as an alternative that has all game filters working properly, taken from the Top Casinos with properly working filters.State that most casinos don’t offer additonal filtering. If the casino offers additional filtering, say that this casino offers it, which means that advanced players and new players alike will find all that they need to pick games that suit their taste. If the casino doesn’t offer additional filtering, say that this casino sadly isn’t one of the casinos that offer this and recommend one or two other brands that do offer additional filtering, from the Top Casinos that offer addotional filtering.",
    "Responsible Gambling": "[Paragraph 1: Self-exclusion, other tools, cooling-off]:If the casino doesn’t offer self-exclusion, warn the reader about this and follow up by saying that this is the most basic and usually mandatory tool for every online casino. If a casino doesn’t have this, it means they are either not operating legally when it comes to responsible gaming, or they don’t care about players enough to offer this tool. If the casino offers self exclusion, say how many other resposnsible gambling tools, except self-exlusion, the casino offers, say which are these tools and follow up by commenting on this number based on this criteria: if the casino offers 3 or 4 of these tools, they are above average and offer the safest experience possible in terms of responsible gambling. If that casino offers 1 or two such tools, they are average, meaning it’s ok, but could be better for the highest safety and ease of mind. If the casino offers no other tools, they need to step up the game; responsible gambling tools don’t bring money to the casino, but create a safer environment for players, which shows care and responsibility on the casino’s side.If the casino also offers a cooling-off option, commend the casino on it, as this isn’t the most common responsible gambling tool and often isn’t found in casinos. This either shows that the casino is hosted on a platform where this tool is also offered, or the casino went the extra mile to offer an even safer environment for its players. If the casino doesn’t offer the cooling-off option, say that this is usually the case in online casinos and if the reader prefers to have this option available, recommend another casino that does offer cooling-off as an alternative option, taken from the Top Casinos with cooling-off option.[Paragraph 2: contacting support for responsible gambling]:State whether responsible gambling tools are available without having to contact support or not. Having these tools available at a click of a button means a much easier control of gambling for a player, and is usually the preferred way. While having to contact support for this means an unnecessary additional step, it’s still better than having no tools to use at all."
