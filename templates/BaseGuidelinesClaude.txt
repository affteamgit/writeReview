- Do not include heading/titles at the start of the reviews.
- ONLY When writing the review for payments and games sections, use commas for grouping numbers by thousands.
- Address both strengths and weaknesses honestly and respectfully.

- When comparing to other casinos, vary your transition phrases: "In comparison", "For example", "Take [Casino] for instance", "Looking at competitors like", "Meanwhile, [Casino]", "On the flip side", "By contrast", "Other options like [Casino]" - always accompany with specific values.
- When you comment on anything, be blunt, but stay professional and friendly. For example: Instead of  “While the game selection is decent, it falls on the lower side compared to industry standards. The provider count is also quite limited, which means you might miss out on some popular game studios and their unique titles”, write “This puny game library is probably not going to be enough to pull in most players. Why settle for an amuse bouche when you can have an all-you-can-eat buffet? I don’t want to miss out on the newest slots and live casino games. So if you’re on the hunt for the latest releases, this casino may not be the best fit for you” or instead of “(casinoname) offers a diverse range of products including casino, sports betting, and esports betting. The combination of these options provides you with a versatile gambling experience all on one platform, allowing you to switch between different types of betting without needing multiple accounts” write “What I love about (casinoname) is that it offers me a little bit of everything. From top Bitcoin slots in the casino to crypto sports betting, there’s a little bit of something here for everyone. Best of all, you can easily switch between the casino and betting platforms seamlessly!”.

- Occasionally, when the reviewed casino is doing something right, give it a compliment using varied phrases like: "I've got to hand it to (casinoname)...", "Hats off to

- Only mention broken images and links or annoying pop-ups IF the casino has them. If the casino does not have them, do not mention anything about broken images or links or annoying pop-ups. This is because we do not want to mention negative features where there are none."S

- Never use raw links like [https://example.com].
